            <h2>Pleased to meet you.</h2>
            <p>
              I'm an American native English-speaker living in Israel. Education
              was my first career; web development is my new love. I utilize my
              prior skills from teaching: characterizing and motivating a target
              audience, crafting memorable presentations, and problem-solving.
              Now I have added modern web-development languages and techniques
              to that skillset. My goal is to work within a team of dedicated
              professionals to create websites that are educational and engaging
              for modern learners.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love being in nature and working with natural materials:
              spinning yarns from fibers and experimenting with plants and seeds
              to create my own dyes. Writing code is similar: we weave the
              strands of purpose, words and design elements to create a finished
              product that combines strength, utility, and beauty -- in fiber
              and in code.
            </p>

            <h2>A new direction</h2>
            <p>
              I enjoy the detail, precision, and creativity of coding. It is so
              satisfying to take a website idea and make it all work -- and look
              fabulous! I know that ease of collaboration, trouble-shooting, and
              updating is important to clients, and I approach every project
              with this foundation of correct, concise, and elegant code in
              mind. Client services include everything from coding web pages
              from design comps to the "full stack" of building functionality
              into your website on the client side and the server side.
            </p>
            <p>
              I look forward to being part of a cohesive team. Collaboration
              with other dedicated professionals was always part of my
              professional life; it is exhilarating because every perspective is
              slightly different and the give-and-take offers potentially new
              skills and techniques to enhance our product. I learn from
              everyone and grow every day, because to me that is the essence of
              life.

              This is an app I will design to help students organize on-line
              resources and create a personalized self-study schedule, with
              built-in progress and time tracking for accountability. It is
              appropriate for learners from Jr. High to adult. I will use HTML5
              and CSS3 for the design, javaScript and React for the
              functionality.

            <h4>Description of project:</h4>
            <p>
              This is a Wordpress site designed as a learning project,
              ostensibly for a business marketing firm. The purpose was to
              showcase services and previous client projects, and enhance
              communication with potential clients. I learned to install an
              existing client website, create child themes and custom queries,
              custom post-types and custom fields,custom page templates, and to
              operate on a continuous workflow and deployment cycle. Languages
              used included PHP, CSS3, and HTML-5.

            <h3>Project: Local Library Website</h3>
            <h4>Project listing: January 2021 , Client: Thinkful</h4>

            <h4>Description of project:</h4>
            <p>
              The "client" for this project was a public library. It required a
              website where members could get information about their accounts,
              library book inventory and authors. The HTML and CSS codes were
              provided, as was the data. I learned to write advanced javascript
              functions that would find specific data values, manipulate the
              data and return it in specified formats. An example would be
              sorting the data to find and return the five most popular book
              titles.
